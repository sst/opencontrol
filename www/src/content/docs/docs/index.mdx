OpenControl lets you control your infrastructure with AI. It is meant to live in your codebase and be deployed as a part of your infrastructure.

:::note
Here's a [video demo](https://youtu.be/y-VFQ2UkDSM?si=fkuhgDSCOcYK6PVg) of OpenControl on YouTube.
:::

Let's get started.

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install opencontrol hono @ai-sdk/anthropic
   ```
 
   Here we use Anthropic's Claude.

   :::tip
   We've found Claude 3.7 to be the best model for OpenControl.
   :::

2. **Create the server**

   ```bash
   touch src/opencontrol.ts
   ```

   ```ts title=src/opencontrol.ts
   import { create } from "opencontrol"
   import { handle } from "hono/aws-lambda"
 
   const app = create({
     // model: ...,
     // tools: [ ]
   })
 
   export const handler = handle(app)
   ```

3. **Pick the model**

   ```diff lang=ts title=src/opencontrol.ts
   + import { Resource } from "sst"
   + import { createAnthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic"
 
   const app = create({
   +  model: createAnthropic({
   +    apiKey: Resource.AnthropicKey.value,
   +  })("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219")
   })
   ```

4. **Define your tools**

   ```diff lang=ts title=src/opencontrol.ts
   + import { tool } from "opencontrol/tool"
   + import { Inventory } from "@acme/core/inventory/index"
 
   + const inventory = tool({
   +   name: "inventory_record",
   +   description: "Record new inventory event to track in or out amounts",
   +   args: Inventory.record.schema,
   +   async run(input) {
   +     return Inventory.record(input)
   +   }
   + })
 
   const app = create({
     tools: [
   +    inventory
     ]
   })
   ```

   We've got some more [examples of tools](/docs/tools/) you can use.

5. **Infrastructure**

   We are using [`OpenControl`](https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/opencontrol/) SST component here. But since **OpenControl is just a Hono app, you can deploy it however you want**.
 
   ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {1,6}
   const anthropicKey = new sst.Secret("AnthropicKey")
   
   const server = new sst.aws.OpenControl("MyServer", {
     server: {
       handler: "src/opencontrol.handler",
       link: [anthropicKey]
     }
   })
   ```
 
   We are defining a secret for the Anthropic API key and linking it to our OpenControl server.

6. **Link any resources**

   ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {6}
   const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket")
 
   const server = new sst.aws.OpenControl("MyServer", {
     server: {
       handler: "src/opencontrol.handler",
       link: [bucket]
     }
   })
   ```
 
   If your tools need to access to your resources, you can link them as well.

7. **Grant permissions**

   If you are using the AWS tool, you'll need to give your OpenControl server permissions to access your AWS account.
 
   ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4-6}
   const server = new sst.aws.OpenControl("MyServer", {
     server: {
       handler: "src/opencontrol.handler",
       policies: $dev
         ? ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"]
         : ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess"]
     }
   })
   ```
 
   Here we are giving it admin access in dev but read-only access in prod.

8. **Deploy**

   Currently, OpenControl uses basic auth but we'll be adding support for OAuth soon.

   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
   return {
     OpenControlUrl: server.url,
     OpenControlPassword: server.password
   }
   ```

   You can print out the URL of your server and it's password and deploy.

   ```bash
   sst deploy
   ```

Now head over to the URL, login with the password, and you can use AI to talk to your infrastructure.
